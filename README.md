## üìñ Overview

**Higher or Lower: Follower Comparison Game** is a command-line Python project that puts players‚Äô intuition and pop culture knowledge to the test. The objective is simple yet addictive:  
> *Guess who has a higher follower count between two randomly chosen public figures or brands.*

With every correct answer, the score increases. And with one wrong guess, it‚Äôs game over.  
This project emphasizes structured programming practices, modular code design, and data driven logic, all within a clean and engaging text based UI.  
It offers a great example of how fundamental programming skills can be applied to build interactive and replayable software experiences using Python.

Whether you‚Äôre a budding developer refining your skills or someone exploring creative ways to practice coding, this game serves as an ideal project to solidify core Python concepts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts Used

> This project goes beyond basic scripting by showcasing foundational and intermediate Python development principles through an engaging CLI game.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Python 3.x** ‚Äì The entire game is built using Python, emphasizing structured scripting and modularity.
- üß© **Modular Programming** ‚Äì The codebase is split into multiple files (`main.py`, `art.py`, `game_data.py`) promoting clarity, reuse, and maintainability.
- üîÅ **Control Flow & Decision Logic** ‚Äì Implements conditional statements (`if`, `else`) and loops to manage user input and game progression.
- üéØ **Function Design** ‚Äì Key logic is encapsulated in reusable functions like `format_data()` and `check_answer()` to enforce clean, testable code.
- üé≤ **Randomization** ‚Äì Uses Python‚Äôs `random.choice()` for dynamic, unpredictable entity selection critical for replayability.
- üß± **Data Handling** ‚Äì Effectively manipulates dictionaries and lists to store, retrieve, and display structured celebrity data.
- üìú **String Interpolation** ‚Äì Dynamic message generation using `f-strings` to personalize game feedback in real time.
- üé® **ASCII Art Integration** ‚Äì Enhances CLI experience with visually engaging splash screens and separators stored in a separate module.
- üöÄ **Beginner-Friendly Design** ‚Äì Designed with educational value, simulating real world development patterns in a simplified environment.

## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

> A clean and logic driven game loop that blends strategy with intuition, encouraging players to think critically based on cultural knowledge.

- üîÑ **Continuous Round Loop** ‚Äì The game progresses until the player makes an incorrect guess, using smooth transitions from one round to the next.
- üë• **Dynamic Comparisons** ‚Äì Players compare two random personalities/brands based on hidden follower counts.
- üìà **Score Progression** ‚Äì Each correct guess increases the player‚Äôs score, providing feedback and a sense of achievement.
- üß† **Deductive Reasoning** ‚Äì Players are challenged to infer who‚Äôs more popular based on their own knowledge of the figures.
- üßπ **Duplicate Prevention** ‚Äì Built-in logic ensures two different entities are always compared therefore avoiding redundant or broken comparisons.
- üéØ **Guess Evaluation System** ‚Äì Validates player input against real data, then provides context aware feedback using formatted strings.
- üñºÔ∏è **Visual Consistency** ‚Äì Each round displays consistent visual structure (Compare A ‚Üí VS ‚Üí Compare B), enhancing user cognition.
- üö´ **Game Termination** ‚Äì The game exits gracefully on a wrong answer, clearly displaying the final score for closure.
- üîß **Scalable Logic Base** ‚Äì Easily extendable to include categories, difficulty levels, or even a GUI in future iterations.
