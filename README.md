## 📖 Overview

**Higher or Lower: Follower Comparison Game** is a command-line Python project that puts players’ intuition and pop culture knowledge to the test. The objective is simple yet addictive:  
> *Guess who has a higher follower count between two randomly chosen public figures or brands.*

With every correct answer, the score increases. And with one wrong guess, it’s game over.  
This project emphasizes structured programming practices, modular code design, and data driven logic, all within a clean and engaging text based UI.  
It offers a great example of how fundamental programming skills can be applied to build interactive and replayable software experiences using Python.

Whether you’re a budding developer refining your skills or someone exploring creative ways to practice coding, this game serves as an ideal project to solidify core Python concepts.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

> This project goes beyond basic scripting by showcasing foundational and intermediate Python development principles through an engaging CLI game.

- ⚙️ **Python 3.x** – The entire game is built using Python, emphasizing structured scripting and modularity.
- 🧩 **Modular Programming** – The codebase is split into multiple files (`main.py`, `art.py`, `game_data.py`) promoting clarity, reuse, and maintainability.
- 🔁 **Control Flow & Decision Logic** – Implements conditional statements (`if`, `else`) and loops to manage user input and game progression.
- 🎯 **Function Design** – Key logic is encapsulated in reusable functions like `format_data()` and `check_answer()` to enforce clean, testable code.
- 🎲 **Randomization** – Uses Python’s `random.choice()` for dynamic, unpredictable entity selection critical for replayability.
- 🧱 **Data Handling** – Effectively manipulates dictionaries and lists to store, retrieve, and display structured celebrity data.
- 📜 **String Interpolation** – Dynamic message generation using `f-strings` to personalize game feedback in real time.
- 🎨 **ASCII Art Integration** – Enhances CLI experience with visually engaging splash screens and separators stored in a separate module.
- 🚀 **Beginner-Friendly Design** – Designed with educational value, simulating real world development patterns in a simplified environment.

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

> A clean and logic driven game loop that blends strategy with intuition, encouraging players to think critically based on cultural knowledge.

- 🔄 **Continuous Round Loop** – The game progresses until the player makes an incorrect guess, using smooth transitions from one round to the next.
- 👥 **Dynamic Comparisons** – Players compare two random personalities/brands based on hidden follower counts.
- 📈 **Score Progression** – Each correct guess increases the player’s score, providing feedback and a sense of achievement.
- 🧠 **Deductive Reasoning** – Players are challenged to infer who’s more popular based on their own knowledge of the figures.
- 🧹 **Duplicate Prevention** – Built-in logic ensures two different entities are always compared therefore avoiding redundant or broken comparisons.
- 🎯 **Guess Evaluation System** – Validates player input against real data, then provides context aware feedback using formatted strings.
- 🖼️ **Visual Consistency** – Each round displays consistent visual structure (Compare A → VS → Compare B), enhancing user cognition.
- 🚫 **Game Termination** – The game exits gracefully on a wrong answer, clearly displaying the final score for closure.
- 🔧 **Scalable Logic Base** – Easily extendable to include categories, difficulty levels, or even a GUI in future iterations.
